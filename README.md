This is the Kairos kcrypt-challenger Kubernetes Native Extension. 

## Usage

See the documentation in our website: https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/partition_encryption/.

### TPM NV Memory Cleanup

‚ö†Ô∏è **DANGER**: This command removes encryption passphrases from TPM memory!
‚ö†Ô∏è **If you delete the wrong index, your encrypted disk may become UNBOOTABLE!**

During development and testing, the kcrypt-challenger may store passphrases in TPM non-volatile (NV) memory. These passphrases persist across reboots and can accumulate over time, taking up space in the TPM.

To clean up TPM NV memory used by the challenger:

```bash
# Clean up the default NV index (respects config or defaults to 0x1500000)
kcrypt-discovery-challenger cleanup

# Clean up a specific NV index
kcrypt-discovery-challenger cleanup --nv-index=0x1500001

# Clean up with specific TPM device
kcrypt-discovery-challenger cleanup --tpm-device=/dev/tpmrm0
```

**Safety Features:**
- By default, the command shows warnings and prompts for confirmation
- You must type "yes" to proceed with deletion
- Use `--i-know-what-i-am-doing` flag to skip the prompt (not recommended)

**Note**: This command uses native Go TPM libraries and requires appropriate permissions to access the TPM device.

## TODO: Implement Selective Enrollment Mode for Attestation Data

### Problem Statement

Currently, the TPM attestation system faces operational challenges in real-world deployments:

1. **Test Complexity**: Tests require manually creating SealedVolumes with complex mock attestation data (EK, AK, PCR values)
2. **Upgrade Compatibility**: Kernel upgrades change PCR values, causing TPM quarantine and disk inaccessibility  
3. **Operational Flexibility**: No mechanism for operators to reset/update attestation data after TPM replacement, firmware upgrades, or key rotation

### Proposed Solution: Selective Enrollment Mode

Implement a "selective enrollment mode" with two distinct behaviors:

#### **Initial TOFU Enrollment** (No SealedVolume exists)
- **Store ALL PCRs** provided by the client (don't omit any)
- Create complete attestation baseline from first contact
- Enables full security verification for subsequent attestations

#### **Selective Re-enrollment** (SealedVolume exists with specific fields)
- **Empty values** (`""`) = Accept any value, update the stored value (re-enrollment mode)
- **Set values** (`"abc123..."`) = Enforce exact match (enforcement mode)  
- **Omitted fields** = Skip verification entirely (ignored mode)

**Selective Enrollment Behavior Summary:**

| Field State | Verification | Updates | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Empty** (`""`) | ‚úÖ Accept any value | ‚úÖ Update with current | Re-learn after TPM/firmware changes |
| **Set** (`"abc123"`) | ‚úÖ Enforce exact match | ‚ùå No updates | Strict security enforcement |
| **Omitted** (deleted) | ‚ùå Skip entirely | ‚ùå Never re-enrolled | Ignore volatile PCRs (e.g., PCR 11) |

### Required Implementation Changes

#### 1. **SealedVolume API Enhancement**
```yaml
# Example 1: Initial TOFU (no SealedVolume exists)
# Server creates this automatically with ALL received PCRs:
spec:
  TPMHash: "computed-from-client"
  attestation:
    ekPublicKey: "learned-ek"
    akPublicKey: "learned-ak"  
    pcrValues:
      pcrs:
        "0": "abc123..."        # All received PCRs stored
        "7": "def456..."        
        "11": "ghi789..."       # Including PCR 11 if provided

# Example 2: Selective Re-enrollment (operator control)
spec:
  TPMHash: "required-tmp-hash"  # MUST be set for client matching
  attestation:
    ekPublicKey: ""             # Empty = re-enrollment mode
    akPublicKey: "fixed-ak"     # Set = enforce this value
    pcrValues:
      pcrs:
        "0": ""                 # Empty = re-enrollment mode
        "7": "fixed-value"      # Set = enforce this value
        # "11": omitted         # Omitted = skip entirely (flexible boot stages)
```

#### 2. **Server Logic Updates**
- **TOFU Logic**: When no SealedVolume exists, store ALL received PCRs (don't omit any)
- **Re-enrollment Logic**: 
  - Modify `verifyAKMatch()` to handle empty AK fields as re-enrollment mode
  - Modify `verifyPCRValues()` to handle empty PCR values as re-enrollment mode
  - Handle omitted PCR fields as "skip verification entirely"
- Add logic to update SealedVolume specs when learning new values
- Ensure TPM hash is always required and validated for client matching

#### 3. **Test Simplification**
Replace complex mock attestation data in tests with simple enrollment mode:
```yaml
# tests/encryption_test.go - remote-static test
spec:
  TPMHash: "computed-from-vm"   # Get from /system/discovery/kcrypt-discovery-challenger
  partitions:
    - label: COS_PERSISTENT
      secret: {name: "static-passphrase", path: "pass"}
  attestation: {}               # Full enrollment mode
```

### Use Cases Solved

1. **Pure TOFU**: No SealedVolume exists ‚Üí System learns ALL attestation data from first contact
2. **Static Passphrase Tests**: Create Secret + SealedVolume with TPM hash, let TOFU handle attestation data
3. **Production Manual Setup**: Operators set known passphrases + TPM hashes, system learns remaining security data
4. **Firmware Upgrades**: Set PCR 0 to empty to re-learn after BIOS updates
5. **TPM Replacement**: Set AK/EK fields to empty to re-learn after hardware changes
6. **Flexible Boot Stages**: Omit PCR 11 entirely so users can decrypt during boot AND after full system startup
7. **Kernel Updates**: Omit PCR 11 to avoid quarantine on routine Kairos upgrades

### Practical Operator Workflows

#### **Scenario 1: Reusing Existing Passphrases After SealedVolume Recreation**

**Problem**: An operator needs to recreate a SealedVolume (e.g., after accidental deletion or configuration changes) but wants to keep using the existing passphrase to avoid re-encrypting the disk.

**Solution**: The system automatically reuses existing Kubernetes secrets when available:

```bash
# 1. Operator accidentally deletes SealedVolume
kubectl delete sealedvolume my-encrypted-volume

# 2. Original secret still exists in cluster
kubectl get secret my-encrypted-volume-encrypted-data
# NAME                                  TYPE     DATA   AGE
# my-encrypted-volume-encrypted-data    Opaque   1      5d

# 3. When TPM client reconnects, system detects existing secret
# and reuses the passphrase instead of generating a new one
```

**Behavior**: The system will:
- Detect the existing secret with the same name
- Log: "Secret already exists, reusing existing secret"
- Use the existing passphrase for decryption
- Recreate the SealedVolume with current TPM attestation data
- Maintain continuity without requiring disk re-encryption

#### **Scenario 2: Deliberately Skipping PCRs After Initial Enrollment**

**Problem**: An operator initially enrolls with PCRs 0, 7, and 11, but later realizes PCR 11 changes frequently due to kernel updates and wants to ignore it permanently.

**Solution**: Remove the PCR from the SealedVolume specification:

```bash
# 1. Initial enrollment created SealedVolume with:
# pcrValues:
#   pcrs:
#     "0": "abc123..."
#     "7": "def456..."  
#     "11": "ghi789..."

# 2. Operator edits SealedVolume to remove PCR 11 entirely
kubectl edit sealedvolume my-encrypted-volume
# Remove the "11": "ghi789..." line completely

# 3. Result - omitted PCR 11:
# pcrValues:
#   pcrs:
#     "0": "abc123..."
#     "7": "def456..."
#     # PCR 11 omitted = ignored entirely
```

**Behavior**: The system will:
- Skip PCR 11 verification entirely (no enforcement)
- Never re-enroll PCR 11 in future attestations
- Log: "PCR verification successful using selective enrollment" (without mentioning PCR 11)
- Continue enforcing PCRs 0 and 7 normally

#### **Scenario 3: Manual PCR Selection During Initial Setup**

**Problem**: An operator knows certain PCRs will be unstable and wants to exclude them from the beginning.

**Solution**: Create the initial SealedVolume manually with only desired PCRs:

```yaml
# Create SealedVolume with selective PCR enforcement from the start
apiVersion: keyserver.kairos.io/v1alpha1
kind: SealedVolume
metadata:
  name: selective-pcr-volume
spec:
  TPMHash: "known-tpm-hash"
  partitions:
    - label: "encrypted-data"
      secret:
        name: "my-passphrase"
        path: "passphrase"
  attestation:
    ekPublicKey: ""          # Re-enrollment mode
    akPublicKey: ""          # Re-enrollment mode  
    pcrValues:
      pcrs:
        "0": ""              # Re-enrollment mode (will learn)
        "7": ""              # Re-enrollment mode (will learn)
        # "11": omitted      # Skip PCR 11 entirely
```

**Behavior**: The system will:
- Learn and enforce PCRs 0 and 7 on first attestation
- Completely ignore PCR 11 (never verify, never store)
- Allow flexible boot stages without PCR 11 interference

#### **Scenario 4: Kernel Upgrade - Temporary PCR Re-enrollment**

**Problem**: An operator is performing a kernel upgrade and knows PCR 11 will change, but wants to continue enforcing it after the upgrade (unlike permanent omission).

**Solution**: Set the PCR value to empty string to trigger re-enrollment mode:

```bash
# 1. Before kernel upgrade - PCR 11 is currently enforced
kubectl get sealedvolume my-volume -o jsonpath='{.spec.attestation.pcrValues.pcrs.11}'
# Output: "abc123def456..."  (current PCR 11 value)

# 2. Set PCR 11 to empty string to allow re-enrollment
kubectl patch sealedvolume my-volume --type='merge' \
  -p='{"spec":{"attestation":{"pcrValues":{"pcrs":{"11":""}}}}}'

# 3. Perform kernel upgrade and reboot

# 4. After reboot, TPM client reconnects and system learns new PCR 11 value
# Log will show: "Updated PCR value during selective enrollment, pcr: 11"

# 5. Verify new PCR 11 value is now enforced
kubectl get sealedvolume my-volume -o jsonpath='{.spec.attestation.pcrValues.pcrs.11}'
# Output: "new789xyz012..."  (new PCR 11 value after kernel upgrade)
```

**Behavior**: The system will:
- Accept any PCR 11 value on next attestation (re-enrollment mode)
- Update the stored PCR 11 with the new post-upgrade value
- Resume strict PCR 11 enforcement with the new value
- Log: "Updated PCR value during selective enrollment"

**Key Difference from Scenario 2:**
- **Scenario 2 (Omit PCR)**: PCR 11 permanently ignored, never verified again
- **Scenario 4 (Empty PCR)**: PCR 11 temporarily re-enrolled, then enforced with new value

### Critical Implementation Notes

- **TPM Hash MUST remain mandatory** - without it, multiple clients would match the same SealedVolume
- **EK verification should remain strict** - only AK and PCRs should support enrollment mode
- **Add proper logging** for enrollment events for audit trails
- **Consider rate limiting** to prevent abuse of enrollment mode
- **Update documentation** with operational procedures for each use case

### Quick Reference for Documentation

**Common Operations:**

```bash
# Skip a PCR permanently (never verify again)
kubectl edit sealedvolume my-volume
# Remove the PCR line entirely from pcrValues.pcrs

# Temporarily allow PCR re-enrollment (e.g., before kernel upgrade)
kubectl patch sealedvolume my-volume --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"attestation":{"pcrValues":{"pcrs":{"11":""}}}}}'

# Re-learn a PCR after hardware change (e.g., PCR 0 after BIOS update)  
kubectl patch sealedvolume my-volume --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"attestation":{"pcrValues":{"pcrs":{"0":""}}}}}'

# Re-learn AK after TPM replacement
kubectl patch sealedvolume my-volume --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"attestation":{"akPublicKey":""}}}'

# Check current PCR enforcement status
kubectl get sealedvolume my-volume -o jsonpath='{.spec.attestation.pcrValues.pcrs}' | jq .
```

**Log Messages to Expect:**

- `"Secret already exists, reusing existing secret"` - Passphrase reuse scenario
- `"Updated PCR value during selective enrollment"` - Re-enrollment mode active
- `"PCR verification successful using selective enrollment"` - Omitted PCRs ignored
- `"PCR enforcement mode verification passed"` - Strict enforcement active

### Priority: High
This blocks current test failures and addresses fundamental operational challenges for production deployments.
